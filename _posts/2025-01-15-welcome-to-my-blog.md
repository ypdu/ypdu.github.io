Welcome to my new blog! I've finally decided to start writing about my research journey, thoughts on NLP and machine learning, and various technical topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

You can expect posts about:

- **Research insights**: Sharing lessons learned from my work on attribution, memorization, and language models
- **Technical tutorials**: How-to guides on various NLP and ML techniques
- **Paper reviews**: My thoughts on interesting papers in the field
- **Academic life**: Tips and experiences from graduate school and research

## Why Start a Blog?

As a PhD student working on NLP and ML, I often come across interesting ideas, debugging stories, and "aha!" moments that I think could be valuable to share. This blog will serve as both a personal record and hopefully a resource for others in the field.

I'm particularly excited to write about:
- Attribution methods for language models
- The fascinating relationship between memorization and generalization
- Practical tips for ML research and experimentation

## Stay Tuned

I'll be posting regularly about my research adventures. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover!
