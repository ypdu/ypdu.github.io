I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Utrecht University, 
advised by [Dr. Dong Nguyen](https://www.dongnguyen.nl/). 
My current research interests lie within Natural Language Processing 
(esp. interpretability of NLP models). 
Besides, I am broadly interested in Machine Learning 
(esp. Deep Learning) and Computational Social Science. 

Before joining UU, 
I received both my bachelor's (Psychology, 2017) and 
my master's (Computer Science, 2020, advised by [Dr. Yuanbin Wu](https://ybwu.org/)) 
degrees from East China Normal University.
