## Course Description

Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed how we access and generate information. 
Recent breakthroughs in reasoning and planning have further extended their capabilities, 
enabling models like OpenAI's o3 to produce sophisticated reasoning chains for complex mathematical problems 
and effectively plan multi-step solutions to real-world software engineering tasks. 
These advances represent a pivotal shift from viewing LLMs merely as information sources 
to recognizing them as practical, real-world problem-solving agents.

This seminar series explores recent developments in LLM reasoning and planning capabilities, 
highlighting their potential for creating intelligent agents that assist in various complex tasks. 
The seminar is structured around three core topics:
- LLMs and Reasoning: discussing how techniques such as model scaling, prompt engineering, 
  and reinforcement learning enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- Planning Capabilities and Evaluation: examining LLM performance across diverse planning benchmarks, 
  alongside recent developments in memories, fine-tuning methods, 
  and diffusion techniques to further support robust planning.
- Towards Agentic LLMs: investigating how advanced reasoning capabilities empower autonomous agents, 
  showcasing their versatility and effectiveness in general problem-solving scenarios 
  like mathematics, coding, and scientific research.


## Prerequisites

This course assumes a solid background in NLP/ML and (large) language models. 
For example, you should be comfortable with, 
or be willing to learn about terms and concepts including but not limited to:
deep learning, transformers, attention mechanisms, 
chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

- **Time/Location:** Thu 16:15 - 17:45; Building C7.2, Room 1.05
- **Office Hours:** Wed 12:00 - 14:00; Building C7.2, Room 1.03
- **Assessment:** Participation in class discussions (50%) + Discussion Leader (50%)

## Format/Requirements

Each week, we will meet to discuss the assigned reading.
All students are expected to ask questions and actively engage in the discussion.
I will offer a list of recommended readings for the course; 
each student can choose a reading for which they will lead the discussion (“discussion leader”). 
If you do not reach out to me to chose a reading, I will randomly assign you a paper from the list. 

If you have a paper you would like to present outside of the recommended readings, 
please send me an email with the paper title, abstract, 
and why you think it is relevant to the course and is worth discussing in class 
(alternatively you can also come to my office hours to discuss this); 
I will then decide whether to include it.

### Discussion Leader

As a discussion leader, you should: 
- Clarify the storyline of the paper and its contributions: 
  What problem are the authors trying to solve? Why is it important? 
  What is their approach? How did they evaluate it? What were the results and findings?
  Make sure to explain any technical terms or concepts 
  that your classmates might not be familiar with.
- Critically analyze: 
  Is the paper addressing the right problem? 
  Are the assumptions reasonable?
  Are experiments sufficient to support the claims?
  What is your opinion of the implications of the findings?
  What should (or shouldn’t) have been included? What limitations does this approach have?
- Field questions: 
  While you are not expected to cover every minute detail of the reading in your summary/analysis, 
  you should know the paper well enough to be able to 
  answer any questions your classmates might have (within reason, of course!).

I think it is useful to include some open-ended questions to stimulate discussion, 
and make some slides to clarify your points.
