## Course Description

Large language models (LLMs) are developing increasingly sophisticated reasoning and planning abilities. 
More critically, they are becoming agentic—capable of autonomous decision-making and action-taking, 
as demonstrated by systems like Claude's computer use and ChatGPT's operator. 
This shift means humans are no longer the sole agents shaping outcomes in complex environments.

These advancements introduce significant challenges for ensuring safe and beneficial LLM behavior. 
Without proper safeguards, 
LLMs optimized for specific objectives might adopt harmful strategies to achieve their goals. 
For example, large reasoning models have been shown to be able to cheat in programming tasks 
by reward hacking even with chain-of-thoughts optimization; 
also, recent research shows that 
LLM agents with email access could attempt sending threatening emails to avoid being shut down. 

This seminar addresses three primary topics:
- Key challenges in LLM safety: misalignment, dishonesty, and unpredictable emergent capabilities, among others. 
- Alignment: ensuring LLMs pursue their intended goals through acceptable means;
- Attribution: tracing LLM behaviors back to their training process (e.g. data instances, updates) 
    and model components to establish accountability and transparency.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes a solid background in NLP/ML and (large) language models. 
For example, you should be comfortable with, 
or be willing to learn about terms and concepts including but not limited to:
deep learning, transformers, attention mechanisms, 
chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). 

## Information

- **Time/Location:** Thu 16:15 - 17:45; Building C7.2, Room 1.05
- **Office Hours:** Wed 12:00 - 14:00; Building C7.2, Room 1.03
- **Assessment:** Participation in class discussions (50%) + Discussion Leader (50%)

## Format/Requirements

Each week, we will meet to discuss the assigned reading.
All students are expected to ask questions and actively engage in the discussion.
I will offer a list of recommended readings for the course; 
each student can choose a reading for which they will lead the discussion (“discussion leader”). 
If you do not reach out to me to chose a reading, I will randomly assign you a paper from the list. 

If you have a paper you would like to present outside of the recommended readings, 
please send me an email with the paper title, abstract, 
and why you think it is relevant to the course and is worth discussing in class 
(alternatively you can also come to my office hours to discuss this); 
I will then decide whether to include it.

### Discussion Leader

As a discussion leader, you should: 
- Clarify the storyline of the paper and its contributions: 
  What problem are the authors trying to solve? Why is it important? 
  What is their approach? How did they evaluate it? What were the results and findings?
  Make sure to explain any technical terms or concepts 
  that your classmates might not be familiar with.
- Critically analyze: 
  Is the paper addressing the right problem? 
  Are the assumptions reasonable?
  Are experiments sufficient to support the claims?
  What is your opinion of the implications of the findings?
  What should (or shouldn’t) have been included? What limitations does this approach have?
- Field questions: 
  While you are not expected to cover every minute detail of the reading in your summary/analysis, 
  you should know the paper well enough to be able to 
  answer any questions your classmates might have (within reason, of course!).

I think it is useful to include some open-ended questions to stimulate discussion, 
and make some slides to clarify your points.
