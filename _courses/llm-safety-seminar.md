## Course Description

Large language models (LLMs) are developing increasingly sophisticated reasoning abilities. 
More critically, they are becoming agentic—capable of autonomous decision-making and action-taking. 
This shift means humans are no longer the sole agents shaping outcomes in complex environments.

These advancements introduce significant challenges for ensuring safe and beneficial LLM behavior. 
Without proper safeguards, 
LLMs might generate unsafe contents or produce harmful behaviors; 
Moreover, they are vulnerable to various attacks,
which can be exploited by malicious actors to induce undesirable outcomes.
This seminar explores recent research studying these challenges, 
covering topics including privacy, interpretability, alignment, attacks, and evaluation.


## Prerequisites

This course assumes basic familiarity with NLP and ML, 
For example, you should be comfortable with, 
or be willing to learn about terms including but not limited to:
large language models, transformers, attention mechanisms, scaling laws, 
chain-of-thought reasoning, and reinforcement learning. 


## Information

- **Instructor:** [Yupei Du](https://yupei.nl/) (yudo [at] lst [dot] uni-saarland [dot] de)
- **Time/Location:** Wed 14:15 - 15:45; Building C7.3, Room 1.14

## Format/Requirements

Each week, we will meet to discuss the assigned topic (see Syllabus). 
Each session will focus on one or two recent papers relevant to the topic of the week, 
led by one or two students who will present the paper(s) for approximately 45-60 minutes, 
followed by a group discussion of another 30-45 minutes.

### For presenters

Discussion is not limited to after presentations only,
and you should regularly pause to ask if there are any questions or comments, 
and encourage the audience to share their thoughts.
Some suggested readings are offered for each topic; 
however, **these are by no means exhaustive, and 
you are very welcome to propose readings that you are interested in to present**, 
as long as they are related to the topic of the seminar! 
Please email me such suggestions at least **one week before the relevant session**,
so that I can review and approve them in time.

It is fine if you do not understand every detail of the paper you’ll present, 
and you are not expected to cover all of them in your presentation.
Rather, our focus will be building understanding about 
the main problems addressed, the background, why they are important, 
why the proposed solutions work (or don’t work), 
and possible engineering tricks used by the authors to improve the results. 
You are also encouraged to critically evaluate the paper, discussing
whether the claims are well-supported by the evidence, its limitations, 
potential future directions, and the broader implications of the work.
**Make sure to make your presentation accessible to the audience,
who may not be familiar with all the technical details of the paper**, 
and do not hesitate to repeat or rephrase things if necessary.
After presentations, please send me your slides and other materials for archiving purposes.

### For audience

All students are expected to ask questions and actively engage in the discussion.
Each session you will be graded based on your participation, including: 
- 0 (not engaged)
- 1 (asked questions or made comments)
- 2 (asked high-quality questions or made thoughtful comments).

## Term paper (for the 7 CP version)

Students taking the course for 7 credits will be expected to write a term paper. 
The term paper follows one of the following two formats:
- A survey paper on a topic relevant to the course; or
- A small yet well-executed independent project. 

For the survey paper, you should pick a topic that you are interested in,
identify a few key problems, 
and choose at least three important papers that address each problem.
Similar to the presentations, you should not only summarize the papers, 
but also clearly frame and motivate the key problems, 
as well as the proposed solutions from each paper, 
analyze their strengths and weaknesses,
and discuss potential future extensions.

For the independent project, 
you should identify a research question that is relevant and interesting to you, 
clearly frame and motivate the problem, discuss past work, 
and propose a set of experiments to address the problem. 
This project can take different forms: 
for example, it can be reproducing and extending an existing work,
systematically comparing different methods on a specific problem,
or proposing a novel method to address an existing problem.
Here is a guide on [how to write an OK research paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNlwVGxkG7Q). 

### Format

Up to 10 pages (excluding references and appendix) texts in 
[NeurIPS format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers). 
The submission should be a PDF file.
There is no strict minimum length, or which software you should use to write the paper.
However, please make sure that the formatting is clear, consistent, and self-contained.
I personally recommend using [Typst](https://typst.app/) or LaTeX for writing. 

### Submission deadline
Due: March end, 2026. Send me an email with the PDF attached, 
with the subject line "Reasoning seminar term paper submission: [Your Name]".

### LLM use policy

This course does not place formal restrictions on the use of LLMs or other AI tools for learning.
However, **any use of AI tools must be clearly documented**.
Moreover, **you are fully responsible for the content of your paper**, 
regardless of whether it was produced by you or with the help of AI.
For example, if your work contains 
poorly executed experiments, logical flaws, plagiarism, or fabricated citations or content, 
no matter the source, your grade will be affected.
Therefore, please use AI tools thoughtfully, responsibly, and with a critical mindset.
