## Project Overview

The Memorization Detection toolkit provides researchers with comprehensive tools to identify, analyze, and understand memorization patterns in neural language models. This project emerged from our research on the relationship between memorization and generalization in reasoning tasks.

### Motivation

Understanding when and how language models memorize training data is crucial for:
- **Privacy Protection**: Identifying potential data leakage
- **Model Understanding**: Distinguishing memorization from generalization
- **Data Curation**: Improving training set quality
- **Fairness**: Detecting biased memorization patterns

## Key Features

### Detection Methods
- **Exact Match Detection**: Find verbatim training sequences
- **Near-Exact Detection**: Identify sequences with minor variations  
- **Semantic Memorization**: Detect memorized concepts vs. surface forms
- **Statistical Tests**: Rigorous hypothesis testing for memorization

### Analysis Tools
- **Memorization Curves**: Track memorization throughout training
- **Data Influence**: Identify which examples drive memorization
- **Layer-wise Analysis**: Understand where memorization occurs
- **Intervention Studies**: Test memorization vs. generalization

### Visualization
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore memorization patterns
- **Training Dynamics**: Visualize memorization emergence
- **Comparison Views**: Compare models and datasets

## Research Findings

Our analysis using this toolkit revealed several key insights:

### 1. Memorization Builds on Generalization
Contrary to common assumptions, we found that memorization doesn't replace generalization but rather **builds upon** generalization capabilities.

### 2. Task-Dependent Patterns
Different reasoning tasks show distinct memorization characteristics:
- **Arithmetic**: High memorization of number facts
- **Logical Reasoning**: Pattern memorization vs. rule learning  
- **Commonsense**: Factual knowledge memorization

### 3. Scale Effects
Model size affects memorization patterns:
- **Small models**: More surface-level memorization
- **Large models**: More semantic memorization
- **Scaling threshold**: Qualitative changes at ~1B parameters

## Usage Examples

### Basic Memorization Detection

```python
from memorization_detector import MemorizationDetector
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load model and detector
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
detector = MemorizationDetector(model, tokenizer)

# Detect memorization in a dataset
results = detector.detect_memorization(
    dataset_path='training_data.jsonl',
    test_sequences=['The quick brown fox'],
    method='statistical_test',
    threshold=0.01
)

# Analyze results
memorized_examples = results.get_memorized(confidence=0.95)
print(f"Found {len(memorized_examples)} memorized examples")
```

### Training Dynamics Analysis

```python
# Track memorization throughout training
dynamics = detector.track_training_dynamics(
    model_checkpoints=['checkpoint-1000', 'checkpoint-2000', ...],
    test_sequences=validation_set
)

# Plot memorization curves
dynamics.plot_memorization_curve(save_path='memo_curve.png')
```

### Layer-wise Memorization Analysis

```python
# Analyze which layers contribute to memorization
layer_analysis = detector.analyze_layers(
    sequences=memorized_examples,
    intervention_type='zero_out'
)

# Identify critical layers
critical_layers = layer_analysis.get_critical_layers(threshold=0.1)
print(f"Memorization primarily occurs in layers: {critical_layers}")
```

## Advanced Features

### Statistical Significance Testing

The toolkit implements rigorous statistical tests for memorization:

```python
# Perform exact binomial test
def statistical_memorization_test(model, sequence, training_data):
    """
    Test if model's performance on sequence is significantly above
    what would be expected from generalization alone.
    """
    # Compute model probability
    model_prob = compute_sequence_probability(model, sequence)
    
    # Estimate baseline from similar sequences
    baseline_prob = estimate_baseline_probability(
        model, sequence, training_data, similarity_threshold=0.8
    )
    
    # Binomial test
    p_value = binomial_test(model_prob, baseline_prob, n_trials=100)
    return p_value < 0.01  # Memorized if p < 0.01
```

### Privacy Analysis

```python
# Identify potential privacy violations
privacy_analyzer = detector.analyze_privacy_risks(
    training_data='private_dataset.jsonl',
    threshold=1e-6
)

# Generate privacy report
privacy_analyzer.generate_report('privacy_analysis.pdf')
```

### Intervention Studies

```python
# Test if removing memorized examples affects performance
intervention = detector.run_intervention_study(
    memorized_examples=memorized_examples,
    eval_dataset=evaluation_set,
    intervention_type='remove_examples'
)

print(f"Performance drop after removing memorized examples: {intervention.performance_drop:.3f}")
```
